### Vile Characters of Fake
   


The Pope has spoken about the sin of fake news; a few hours before, finishing up writing and compositing a graphic to post at my twitter account, titled ‘Homage to a Journalist’. So very lost in the ‘Fake News” stories is what about the children, so obvious; like how about looking into what is actually going on! Yesterday Andrew Coats wrote ‘Pizzagate, it’s not news at all, fake or otherwise; it’s just illogical speculation..   perhaps the best thing for all of us is to just grab a slice, sit back, and forget this whole thing ever happened.’ Was this as bad as the whole disgusting fake news could get, no! I had been thinking of writing to the Academy Award winning documentarian Alex Gibney, to thank him for Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God (the winner of three primetime Emmy awards). I made a graphic for twitter, with this text:



Thank You Alex Gibney for being so kind to my brother, Bob
   
my Mother would have appreciated Greatly!


could you please look at PizzaGate

So depraved, hideous and horrid!



Lost in the Vatican story, unspeakable evil and its assault against mothers! And their are these minions,  embracing, purposefully, blood money extortion with ritualized torture of Children, oh, of course that is what has become of PizzaGate.

What a day, joy with many, many tears, sobbing about my mother. One last check on the finest group of humanity, this side of WikiLeaks, where the PizzaGate action is a happening, over at https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/ a post about the Pope; first, obviously these, really not sure from here out, what to call them! I will not repeat his message as it is clearly a state of putridity, a projection of insidious treachery upon those faithful, holy spirit guided, caring and loving people's.



### Thanksgiving of 1957 in Madison, Wisconsin

3 and a half, and it’s this big deal, my mom is so happy, my older brother bob to be home from school in Milwaukee, with Father Murphy and Mr. Blum honored guests, yeah, watch the movie. I remember this vividly, as i reached out my little hand, to his touch so slimy my hand flew back before my mother grabbed me, with her gentle smile of kindness; years after, my dad into my eyes ‘i just didn’t see it, the Whole thing!’.

### Urgency

If you are open, all your senses together, this is Common Sense; and a functional primordial wisdom. You grow this little seedling inside to blossom a divine awareness, being; extraordinary, deep in sensation. All around us is this urgency; look without binding to it, important, let the incessant chatter of fear disappear, in stillness you go deep inside, there is great power in this, if you use are free of self importance, free of evil and perversion of righteousness; organically growing what is already inside you, with true courage, it is easy, simple. Arrogance morphs into misery and famine. This is ancient, any concrete formation of belief starts crumbling away, look at everything, look at the bindings by group participation, labeling you into some hidden set theory, and when you really see it for what it is, it loses any power over you! Surrounded by a perversion of a culture, that is collapsing by its own volition! Urgency is you getting it together, living authentically a divine being, with tremendous power in this! And if you happen to some location, with distraught in the air, walk softly and gather goodness within.

### Volition of Depravity - Ritualized Torture

On my way north to Ketchum, Sun Valley Idaho in the autumn of 1984, just past Hailey, where Ezra Pound was born; so beloved to those writers in Europe for his great generosity, Hemingway would save him from a lobotomy; St. Elizabeth's hospital in Washington DC, a prison kept for these and other problems.

This beautiful morning of 1989, after successfully completing my first professional caretaking job in the Rockies, at the Circle A, then to the M-bar-M, loved Idaho, just had to get back to California, a large house in Aptos-Santa Cruz, to here in Shasta County, California. The view of Mount Shasta is stunning, the way the land faces, have been informed, here a special place to the Natives of the past, here has been bonfires of ritual. This was not an investigation, amidst a disintegrating moving elsewhere, very large methamphetamine cooking operation, spread out in remote locations, in what is called inter-mountain, northern sierra to southern cascade; my directive as follows, begin a process of purification, the land, dis-embodied soul-spirits stuck here, important: i am doing nothing, other than, being a divine presence, of course each encounter is different, tis best no dialog, stay out of the way!

And when that day a father arrives from far away, years of tears and asks,  have you spoken to my child; It is the Divine that comforts him, speak with honor what purpose my directive. He in the distance walking away, you know something good has Happened!

I would be remiss if i failed to mention, later a friend asked me if i had heard about Cathy O'Brien and Lake Shasta, i had not. In 1992, while burning house's of evidence, the 64,000 acre fire called The Fountain Fire.

### We Love You - Drink This!

Horrific things in the laboratory's, dripping into the food supply; really no surprise that John Podesta would be involved as an operative, lobbyist. Looking like his handler might be George Soros, who also looks to be behind the New York Times, Washington Post's Russia story's, and where he resides!



### Functional Side-Effects

Speaking of Soros, if you venture to build an app, trusted and free of tunnels to hack through; voting machine companies are not interested in that!

### Hearings Sound of Collapse

'Inquiry of Russian Hacking in Election.. potential confrontation.. Trump in his first days in office' New York Times, maybe a break, there insipid smearing of PizzaGate, or crumbling away, the sound is so quiet, with The Washington Post, plenty of hearings.
