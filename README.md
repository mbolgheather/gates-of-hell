Vile Characters of Fake
   

Homage to a Journalist


The Pope has spoken about the sin of fake news; a few hours before, finishing up writing and compositing a graphic to post at my twitter account, titled ‘Homage to a Journalist’. So very lost in the ‘Fake News” stories is what about the children, so obvious; like how about looking into what is actually going on! Yesterday Andrew Coats wrote ‘Pizzagate, it’s not news at all, fake or otherwise; it’s just illogical speculation..   perhaps the best thing for all of us is to just grab a slice, sit back, and forget this whole thing ever happened.’ Was this as bad as the whole disgusting fake news could get, no! I had been thinking of writing to the Academy Award winning documentarian Alex Gibney, to thank him for Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God (the winner of three primetime Emmy awards). I made a graphic for twitter, with this text:



Thank You Alex Gibney for being so kind to my brother, Bob
   
my Mother would have appreciated Greatly!


could you please look at PizzaGate

So depraved, hideous and horrid!



Lost in the Vatican story, unspeakable evil and its assault against mothers! And their are these minions,  embracing, purposefully, blood money extortion with ritualized torture of Children, oh, of course that is what has become of PizzaGate.

What a day, joy with many, many tears, sobbing about my mother. One last check on the finest group of humanity, this side of WikiLeaks, where the PizzaGate action is a happening, over at https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/ a post about the Pope; first, obviously these, really not sure from here out, what to call them! I will not repeat his message as it is clearly a state of putridity, a projection of insidious treachery upon those faithful, holy spirit guided, caring and loving people's.

Thanksgiving of 1957 in Madison, Wisconsin.

3 and a half, and it’s this big deal, my mom is so happy, my older brother bob to be home from school in Milwaukee, with Father Murphy and Mr. Blum honored guests, yeah, watch the movie. I remember this vividly, as i reached out my little hand, to his touch so slimy my hand flew back before my mother grabbed me, with her gentle smile of kindness; years after, my dad into my eyes ‘i just didn’t see it, the Whole thing!’.
